# My_First_Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game that you can play in the command line. The game is written in Python and uses ASCII art to display the different choices.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can download the code for the game from this repository. You can either download the code as a ZIP file or clone the repository using Git.

To download the code as a ZIP file, click on the "Code" button on the repository page and select "Download ZIP". Once the ZIP file has downloaded, extract the contents to a folder on your computer.

To clone the repository using Git, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/rock-paper-scissors.git
```

Replace "username" with your GitHub username.

## How to Play

To play the game, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted the code or cloned the repository. Then run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

The game will start and you'll be prompted to enter your choice of "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors". To make a choice, type the name of your choice and press Enter.

The game will then display the ASCII art for your choice and the computer's choice. It will also display the result of the game (win, lose, or tie).

## Rules

The rules of the game are simple:

- Rock beats scissors.
- Scissors beats paper.
- Paper beats rock.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the game, you can fork the repository and make changes to the code. Once you've made your changes, you can submit a pull request to have your changes reviewed and merged into the main codebase.
